# Multiple serch selector
That sounds like a neat project! Building a small application that utilizes a dummy API to search for users, select them, and manage the selected users is a great way to demonstrate your frontend skills, especially with ReactJS and state management.

Here's how you can structure your project:

1. **Setup React App**: Begin by setting up a new React application using Create React App or any other preferred method.

2. **Component Structure**: Divide your application into components for different functionalities:
   - SearchBar: Component to search for users.
   - UserList: Component to display search results.
   - SelectedUsers: Component to display and manage selected users.
   - UserCard: Component to represent each user in the lists.

3. **State Management**: Utilize Redux for state management, especially for managing selected users.

4. **API Integration**: Use a dummy API to fetch user data. You can use libraries like Axios or fetch for making API requests.

5. **Search Functionality**: Implement search functionality to filter users based on input text.

6. **Select/Deselect Users**: Allow users to select or deselect users from the search results and manage the selected users' state using Redux.

7. **UI Design**: Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling your components and making the UI visually appealing and responsive.

8. **Testing**: Test your application thoroughly, especially the user interactions and Redux state management.

9. **Deployment**: Once everything is working as expected, deploy your application to a platform like Netlify or Vercel for others to see and use.

By building this application, you'll not only showcase your skills but also have a practical project to add to your resume/portfolio. Good luck with your project! If you need further assistance with any specific aspect of the project, feel free to ask.
